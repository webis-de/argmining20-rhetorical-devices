This folder contains all Apache UIMA descriptor files for type systems. A type
system specifies all annotation types to be distinguished within a project.

The ways of using type systems proposed here is to define an 
project-specific type system if needed, but to important the most specific,
more general existing type system into the project-specific type system.

For instance, if some time and money annotations types are needed that do not
exist yet, a financial type system is created with these types. The financial
type system imports the core type system to reuse general annotation types like 
Token, Sentence, Sentiment, etc.
